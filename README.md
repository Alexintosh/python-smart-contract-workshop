## Steps in the workshop

1. Setup [neo-python](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python) and [neo-privatenet-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/metachris/neo-privnet-with-gas/)
2. First smart contract using `print`, `Runtime.Log` and `Runtime.Notify`: [1-print.py](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop/blob/master/1-print.py)
   * Learn using neo-python's `build` command with the `test` argument
   * Test differences between Log and Notify
3. Basic smart contract using storage: [2-storage.py](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop/blob/master/2-storage.py)
   * Storage is one of the key components of most smart contracts
   * Everything is handled as bytes
   * Learn about `debugstorage on/off/reset`
4. A domain registration smart contract: [3-domain.py](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop/blob/master/3-domain.py)
   * users can query, register, transfer and delete domains
   * important concept: checking of ownership
5. NEX ICO template: https://github.com/neonexchange/neo-ico-template


## Recommended Setup

Linux or Mac is recommended, and you need Python 3.5 at the moment. If you are using Windows, either setup a VM or use the Linux Subsystem (see also [here](https://medium.com/@gubanotorious/installing-and-running-neo-python-on-windows-10-284fb518b213) for more infos).

Clone neo-python and setup everything as described in the README. Then create a symlink of this workshop folder to `neo-python/sc`, which makes it easier to import, build and execute the smart contracts in this workshop.


## Typical method signatures

    # These two are just examples for playing around and experimenting:
    def Main():
    def Main(operation):

    # This is how most real smart contracts look like:
    def Main(operation, args):

## Often used imports

    from boa.blockchain.vm.Neo.Runtime import Log, Notify
    from boa.blockchain.vm.Neo.Runtime import GetTrigger, CheckWitness

    from boa.blockchain.vm.Neo.TriggerType import Application, Verification
    from boa.blockchain.vm.Neo.Storage import GetContext, Get, Put, Delete

    from boa.code.builtins import concat


## Often used `build` commands

    neo> build sc/1-print.py test 07 05 True False main
    neo> build sc/2-storage.py test 07 05 True False main
    neo> build sc/3-domain.py test 0710 05 True False query ["test.com"]

#### Timestamps

You can get the last block timestamp from the blockchain with this code.

    def now():
        height = GetHeight()
        current_block = GetHeader(height)
        return current_block.Timestamp

Might not work with neo-boa 0.2.2, downgrade to 0.2.1 (see also https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-boa/issues/35).
